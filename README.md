The app is especially useful for consumers who want to save money by getting the best value for their money. By using the "PriceWise" app, consumers can quickly and easily compare prices and make more informed purchasing decisions, helping them to stretch their budget further and get the most for their money.

The "PriceWise" app is a tool that helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions by comparing the prices and quantities of products. The app is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface that allows users to enter the products' respective quantities and prices.

Once the user has entered this information, the app calculates the unit price for each product (i.e., the price per unit of measurement, such as price per oz, price per pound, etc.) and compares them. The app then tells the user which product is the better deal based on this information and how much they will save upon purchasing this item.
